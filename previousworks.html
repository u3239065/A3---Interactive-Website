                    During 1966, Gordon Andrews was deeply committed to designing Australia’s first decimal currency. His aim was to incorporate modern and unique Australian designs that resemble the culture of Australia drawing major inspiration from native fauna, flora, historical figures and aboriginal artistry. 

His major directive stride was the reject British colonial influences and instead worth with local collaborators such as artists and engravers to achieve high security standards within the notes themselves. His pure passion and dedication to this project led to an iconic and everlasting banknote design that resembled Australian culture but maintaining functionality and security that would lead his designs too become benchmarks of currency design.
