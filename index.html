          The Tocumwal Archive is a collection of stories and photographs, about
          living in the houses that were moved from the Tocumwal air force base
          in New South Wales, to the Canberra suburb of O'Connor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The base was built during the Second World War as an inland defence
          against Japanese invasion. As camouflage, the sleeping quarters for
          air force personnel were built in the form of houses. After the War,
          the acute housing shortage in Canberra gave the houses a new purpose.
          From the late 1940s, about 200 of them were transported to the growing
          suburbs of Ainslie and O'Connor. In O'Connor they were located in two
          groups of four cul-de-sacs meeting at a central park and bounded by
          Macarthur, Macpherson, Miller and Tate Streets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The area is listed as an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) heritage
          precinct. Collection for the Archive began in 1996 with a PhotoAccess
          project supported by the ACT Heritage Council. Stories and photographs
          are archived according to the donor's name. Ongoing community
          collection and maintenance of the Archive is encouraged. The Archive
          is open for research use and the contribution of material at the ACT
          Heritage Library in the Woden Town Library.
