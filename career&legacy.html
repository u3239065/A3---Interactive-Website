              <div class="CL-info__content">Being born and growing up in Ashfield, NSW, Gordon Andrews showed early interest in drawing and carpentry. His younger schooling days, while vital, did not support his creative thinking and unique abilities. Upon leaving his conventional schooling, he studied engineering, 
                art and design at East Sydney Technical College where his skills and unique abilities grew into fruition and exceeded.                                         
                While growing up, his main mentor was his father, who was a stonemason but later studied mechanical engineering. This ignited Gordon Andrews’ inventive personality. Gordon Andrews often pays homage to his late father that ignited his 
                genetic ability of design but for also inspiring him to follow in his footsteps and fulfill his design orientated destiny. </div>

He later contributed to the $5 and $50 notes and advised on polymer banknotes. His career spanned industrial, graphic, and interior design, earning global recognition, including Fellowship in the UK Society of Industrial Artists.

His contemporaries included Grant Featherston, known for his innovative furniture designs, and Douglas Annand, a celebrated graphic designer. Together, these designers 
                helped to shape the visual language of mid-century Australia, bringing international influences into a uniquely Australian context. His work also intersected with the broader architectural and design movements of his time. He collaborated with architects and urban planners, contributing to projects that reflected the increasing modernisation of Australian cities. 
                Andrews was deeply involved in discussions about national identity in design, advocating for an approach that balanced global trends with distinctly Australian elements. </div>
