RATIONALE

Within my final interactive website, a plethora of things went extremely well, while other things were quite rushed since I ultimately ran out of time. Success was evident in my final website, replicating techniques in my website to fruition. Success in certain parts such as the info cards in the home page allowed me to create interactive info tiles that house previewed information for Gordon Andrews’ previous work.

Simple transitions within hover animations such as scale and blur allowed a clean and seamless integration of the proposed prototype in Assignment 2. This was ultimately formatted through display features such as flex and grid which ultimately provided the winning recipe in formatting for both desktop and mobile variants. The use of media queries was a useful tool, dictating each property of certain divisions to visually represent the prototype I curated in Assignment 2. 

A massive takeaway from this assignment was the implementation of my expand cards within the previous work page. To properly replicate the expansion card effect present in A2, I needed to learn a basic element of JavaScript which would allow a switch such as a button to expand the said card. The JavaScript function is basically an element that is used to expand a UI component, and in this case it was my information card. The learning of this basic element, integrated into the HTML allowed my prototype to turn into a polished product, even if that button wasn’t all that flashy. Other areas of success include the grid display of the footer, changing it from a horizontal format with a separator to a vertical format in a mobile variant to allow maximum visual potential and navigation.

Although there are stories of success, there were a few shortcomings in the final design. Shortcoming in the sense of lost time, in which the Career & Legacy page didn’t meet full expectations in reference to the prototype in Figma. The negatives of the final career & legacy page include the similarity of layout to the importance page. I wish I could’ve done it in the animation style and layout as the prototype but a lack of time management ultimately made the decision.

Techniques I used in this final design include filter properties in CSS. This would allow me to create those ‘Glass Morphism’ blurred bubbles within the infographic section of the home page (aka hero image). Another example could be the info cards on the home page, exposing the image text when hovering with a blurred layer underneath. Display techniques such as flex and grid were also extremely essential in this project. Specifically, grid layout was used in the majority of applications to create layouts which would best replicate the visual appeal of my prototype. Grid was used in a multitude of ways within my project, such as within the footer, previous works expansion cards and also but not limited to, ‘importance’ page info cards.

GenAi wasn’t used to create properties or help me with design formulas but was ultimately used to help nullify problems and help me solve them. Since I did run into a platoon of issues, GenAi helped me pinpoint and point out any mistake within my segments of coding.

Overall, I am most pleased with the outcome of the project, learning new skills which would bolster my design career within HTML and CSS boundaries. Comments are left within the code to explain them in a more concise manner but ultimately a lot of time and effort was put into this project to best replicate my prototype. This effort fished myself a whole new language of coding, while a lot of trial and error was used to trial new things or cull old things within my design.
